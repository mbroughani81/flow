I am a highly motivated fifth-year computer science undergraduate student at **Sharif University of Technology (Iran)** with a strong passion for learning and research. My current research interests are **computer systems**, **verification** and **programming languages**. Currently, I am looking for **PhD positions for Fall 2025**!

<br>
My journey in the field of computer science began during my high school years when I discovered programming and algorithms. I studied for National Olympiad and got a silver medal in the end.

<br>
In my university years, after attending an software engineering bootcamp, I found the programming languages an intereseting topic to study. After some experiences, I started to read some materials about computer systems and verification. I found these topics very interesting, because they are the essential foundation for components for a lot of mission critical projects in real world.

Here is a list of my previous works and experiences:

- In Summer 2023, I had the chance to join Dr. Parreaux (HKUST) research group. During this internship, I helped with the implementation and design of some MLscript language features.

- I worked at Hermes Capital company for a year as a Software Engineer. I have been challenged with various software engineering problems and have gained valuable practical experience.

- In Summer 2025, I started a research project with Dr. Kallas (UCLA), focusing an finding optimization solutions for the serverless computation platforms.
