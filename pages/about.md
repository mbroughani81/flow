I am a highly motivated forth-year computer science undergraduate student at Sharif University of Technology (Iran) with a strong passion for learning and research. My journey in the field of computer science began during my high school years when I discovered programming and algorithms, which sparked my curiosity and love for the field.

I have been continuously improving my knowledge and skills in my interest areas. Last summer, I had the opportunity to join an research group and helped with the implementation and design of the MLscript language.  I have been working as a software engineer in a company where I have been challenged with various software engineering problems and have gained valuable practical experience.
